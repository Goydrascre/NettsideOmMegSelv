                There is no guide so you are free to explore wherever you want, whether that be the infamous poison garden, or taking part in the couragus “gift of gab”, a ritual where you hang upside down from the top of the castle, and kiss the wall. This feat supposedly gives you the gift of eloquence, which in layman's terms means the ability to speak persuasively.
