            <h1>Blarney Castle</h1>
            <p>
                Blarney Castle has stood imposingly for over 6 centuries, attracting tourists from all over, 
                not just because of its beautiful medieval architecture, but also because of its history. 
                There is no guide, so you are free to explore wherever you want, whether that be the infamous poison garden, 
                or taking part in the courageous “gift of gab”, a ritual where you hang upside down, 
                suspended by a rope from the top of the castle, and kiss the brick wall. 
                This feat supposedly gives you the gift of eloquence, which means the ability to speak persuasively.
