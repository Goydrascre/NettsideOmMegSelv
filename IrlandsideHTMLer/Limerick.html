                <p>The Flying Boat Museum, located in Foynes, celebrates Limerick's pivotal role in the development of modern airplanes. During the 1930s and 1940s, Foynes was a hub for transatlantic flights, serving as a key stop for flying boats crossing between Europe and North America. The museum showcases this period with interactive exhibits like trying your hand at flying the Boeing 314 yourself in their highly realistic flight simulator. If that's not real enough for you, you can step into the only full-scale replica of a Boeing 314 in the world!
