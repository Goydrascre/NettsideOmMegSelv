                <p>The flying boat museum located in Foynes celebrates Limerick's pivotal role in the development of modern airplanes.

The museum showcases this period with interactive exhibits like trying your hand at flying the Boeing 314 yourself in their highly realistic flight simulator and if that's not real enough for you then you can step into the only Boeing 314 full scale replica in the world!
