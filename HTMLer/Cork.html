                There is no guide so you are free to explore wherever you want, whether that be the infamous poison garden, or taking part in the courageous “gift of gab”, a ritual where you hang upside down, suspended by a rope from the top of the castle, and kiss the brick wall. This feat supposedly gives you the gift of eloquence, which in layman's terms means the ability to speak persuasively.
